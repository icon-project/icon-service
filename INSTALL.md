# How to Install ICON Service

## Envirnoment

* OS: Ubuntu or MacOS
    - Windows is not supported yet.
* Python: 3.6.5+
    - virtualenv is required.
    - Python 3.7 or higher is not supported.

## Prerequisites

Required libraries or services that are to be working with ICON Service

* [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb): Key/Value DB for saving blockchain data
* [libsecp256k](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1): ECDSA-based signing/verification library
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
  * The most popular open source message broker
  * Used for message communication among components such as loopchain, iconservice and iconrpcserver

## Packages

ICON node consists of the following 5 packages.

### iconcommons

Common utilities used in ICON Service and ICON RPC Server
* Logging utils
* Configuration file management

github: https://github.com/icon-project/icon-commons  
pypi: https://pypi.org/project/iconcommons/

### iconservice

ICON Service component plays the following roles:
* Base coin management
* SCORE lifecycle management
* Transaction processing
* SCORE state management

github: https://github.com/icon-project/icon-service  
pypi: https://pypi.org/project/iconservice/

### iconrpcserver

ICON RPC Server component
* Server handling JSON-RPC request and response
* JSON-RPC message syntax check
* Refer to the name of method in a JSON-RPC request and pass it to the appropriate component (loopchain or iconservice)

github: https://github.com/icon-project/icon-rpc-server  
pypi: https://pypi.org/project/iconrpcserver/

### earlgrey

Earlgrey is a python library which provides a convenient way to publish and consume messages between processes using RabbitMQ. It is abstracted to RPC pattern.

github: https://github.com/icon-project/earlgrey  
pypi: https://pypi.org/project/earlgrey/

### loopchain

Blockchain engine for ICON Foundation

github: https://github.com/icon-project/loopchain  
pypi: N/A

## Installation

Assuming that the above prerequisites have been already installed.

```bash
$ virtualenv venv             # Create a virtual environment.
$ source venv/bin/activate    # Enter the virtual enviroment.

# The processes below are executed under virtualenv environment.

# Install python packages being comprised of a ICON node.
(venv) $ pip install iconcommons
(venv) $ pip install iconservice
(venv) $ pip install iconrpcserver
(venv) $ pip install earlgrey
# loopchain package has not been published on pypi.org yet.
# Thus you need to build a python binary package from loopchain source code.
# Refer to the loopchain github repository above
(venv) $ pip install loopchain-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl

# Execute ICON Service
(venv) $ iconservice start -c ./iconservice_config.json
# Execute loopchain
(venv) $ loop peer -d -r ${RADIO_STATION_IP}:${RADIO_STATION_PORT} -o ./peer_conf.json
# Execute JSON-RPC Server
(venv) $ iconrpcserver start -c ./iconrpcserver_config.json
```

## Configuration Files

### iconservice_config.json

Configuration file example of ICON Service.

Once an ICON node starts with a specific configuration, you MUST NOT change it, because changing a configuration can cause the data inconsistency among ICON nodes.

If you want to use a new configuration, stop all nodes, clear their old block data and restart them with the new one.

```json
{
    "log": {
        "colorLog": false,
        "level": "info",
